# Backend API of our VueJS Blog App  

This is a simple Backend API (REST) built with `Django` & `Django REST framework` and his documentation powered by `Swagger`.  
This API will be consumed by a simple blog application developed with views.
All this was conceived on the occasion of our distributed system architecture course where I had to present microservices.
