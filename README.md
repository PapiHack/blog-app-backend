# Backend API of our VueJS Blog App  

This is a simple Backend API (REST) built with `Django` & `Django REST framework` and his documentation powered by `Swagger`.  
This API will be consumed by a simple blog application developed with views.
All this was conceived on the occasion of our distributed system architecture course where I had to present microservices.  

## Endpoints  

- articles  
- users  

## Installation  

You can set up the backend API by running the following commands(in the project directory) :  

- Create a virtual environment : `$ python3 -m venv <virtual_env_name>`  
- Activate your virtual environment : `. venv/bin/activate`  
- Install dependecies : `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Run the API server : `./manage.py runserver`
